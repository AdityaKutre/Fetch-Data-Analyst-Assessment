## üìÇ Project Overview  

This project analyzes three datasets:  

1. **USER_TAKEHOME.csv** ‚Äì User demographic and account information.  
2. **PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME.csv** ‚Äì Product category and brand details.  
3. **TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME.csv** ‚Äì Transactional data, including receipts, purchases, and sales.  

We aim to uncover actionable insights to help improve business decisions and optimize performance.

## üìà Key Findings  

### üö® **Data Quality Issues Identified**  
- **Missing Data:** Significant gaps in key fields such as `CATEGORY_3`, `CATEGORY_4`, and `MANUFACTURER`.  
- **Inconsistent Date Formats:** Variations in date representations across datasets (`CREATED_DATE` vs. `PURCHASE_DATE`).  
- **Duplicate Entries:** Some barcode values appear multiple times, raising concerns about data integrity.  

**üëâ Suggested Action:** Collaborate with the data engineering team to clean and standardize the datasets.

### üîç **Interesting Trends Discovered**  

1. **Power Users Drive Revenue:** Users with accounts older than six months contribute significantly to total sales, making them valuable targets for retention strategies.  
2. **Top-Selling Brands:** Certain brands dominate sales in specific categories, with the potential for cross-selling opportunities.  
3. **Growth Insights:** The company has shown consistent year-over-year (YoY) growth, with seasonal peaks in sales that can be leveraged for targeted campaigns.

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Queries Used  

Below are some of the SQL queries used to derive key insights from the data:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Top 5 Brands by Receipts Scanned Among Users 21 and Over**  
```sql
SELECT P.BRAND, COUNT(T.RECEIPT_ID) AS total_scans 
FROM TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME T 
JOIN PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME P ON T.BARCODE = P.BARCODE 
JOIN USER_TAKEHOME U ON T.USER_ID = U.ID 
WHERE DATEDIFF(YEAR, U.BIRTH_DATE, GETDATE()) >= 21 
GROUP BY P.BRAND 
ORDER BY total_scans DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Year-over-Year Growth Rate Calculation**  
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(PURCHASE_DATE) AS sales_year,
    SUM(FINAL_SALE) AS total_sales,
    LAG(SUM(FINAL_SALE)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(PURCHASE_DATE)) AS previous_year_sales,
    ((SUM(FINAL_SALE) - LAG(SUM(FINAL_SALE)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(PURCHASE_DATE))) / 
      LAG(SUM(FINAL_SALE)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(PURCHASE_DATE))) * 100 AS YoY_growth
FROM TRANSACTION_TAKEHOME
GROUP BY YEAR(PURCHASE_DATE)
ORDER BY sales_year;
```
